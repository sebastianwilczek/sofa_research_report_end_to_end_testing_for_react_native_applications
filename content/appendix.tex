\section{Interview Lucas Gehlen}
\label{appendix:interview_lucas_gehlen}

The following is a transcript of the interview conducted with the \textit{React Native} developer Lucas Gehlen. Formalities at the beginning and the end of the interview that are not related to any relevant information have been omitted from the transcript.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} How do you currently test artefacts developed in \textit{React Native}?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{L. Gehlen:} I don't, really. All I do is manually enter actions and values into the application to test certain use cases.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Does the testing include any repetitive or unnecessary elements?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{L. Gehlen:} Yes. I often run through the same actions to test the same cases over and over again, wasting time.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Could the testing process be made more efficient? If yes, how?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{L. Gehlen:} Probably. I don't really know how though.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} What is included in your development environment? (OS, Mobile OS, emulation, physical devices)
\newline
\newline
\textbf{L. Gehlen:} I use \textit{macOS 10 Sierra} on my development machine, as well as \textit{Android 8 on an Android Emulator}. I do not use any physical devices.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Is it worth it to change existing code or to put extra work into future work on source code, if tests can be made more accessible and easier to use this way?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{L. Gehlen:} No, it is not worth it and way too much effort.

\section{Interview Marco Kull}
\label{appendix:interview_marco_kull}

The following is a transcript of the interview conducted with the \textit{React Native} developer Marco Kull. Formalities at the beginning and the end of the interview that are not related to any relevant information have been omitted from the transcript.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} How do you currently test artefacts developed in \textit{React Native}?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{M. Kull:} I only test by hand, using the application like a normal user would, to see if it works as intended. Very tedious.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Does the testing include any repetitive or unnecessary elements?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{M. Kull:} Yes, I have to wait very long times for the application to be deployed to a device before it is ready. It takes forever to navigate to the things I want to test.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Could the testing process be made more efficient? If yes, how?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{M. Kull:} Yes. A more clear separation of functionality and user interface is needed, this way it would also be possible to do unit testing, which would be nice. It would be great if the navigation could be quicker by using tests.  
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} What is included in your development environment? (OS, Mobile OS, emulation, physical devices)
\newline
\newline
\textbf{M. Kull:} I run \textit{Gentoo Linux} and I have a physical \textit{Nexus 6 P} device running \textit{Android 8}. 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Is it worth it to change existing code or to put extra work into future work on source code, if tests can be made more accessible and easier to use this way?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{M. Kull:} Yes. In a professional setting this should be done in a certain extent, as long as the process of doing so does not put unnecessary strain on the development team.

\section{Interview Patrick Richter}
\label{appendix:interview_patrick_richter}

The following is a transcript of the interview conducted with the \textit{React Native} developer Patrick Richter. Formalities at the beginning and the end of the interview that are not related to any relevant information have been omitted from the transcript.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} How do you currently test artefacts developed in \textit{React Native}?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{P. Richter:} I don't test at all.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Does the testing include any repetitive or unnecessary elements?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{P. Richter:} Nope, since I do not test the application.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Could the testing process be made more efficient? If yes, how?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{P. Richter:} Yes, of course, there needs to be a lot more testing overall.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} What is included in your development environment? (OS, Mobile OS, emulation, physical devices)
\newline
\newline
\textbf{P. Richter:} I have \textit{macOS Mojave} and an \textit{Android 8} device, which is a \textit{Nexus 6 P}.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interviewer:} Is it worth it to change existing code or to put extra work into future work on source code, if tests can be made more accessible and easier to use this way?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{P. Richter:} Of course, that would be reasonable. Seems alright to me.
